			  <h2>Benefits</h2>
			<p class="w3-large">
				One of biggest benefits that this technology can provide is to give surgeons a 
				practice simulation in what to expect or do in a real-time surgery. Sometimes, practice
				& getting to know the what you're working with will give you confidence when working 
				in the real environment. 
				
				<p>"I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, 
				but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times." - Bruce Lee</p>
		  </p>
		  <p class="w3-large">
			  In addition to this benefit, there are also equipments that scan a full 3D body from a patient
			  that they are working with. This way, they can be more accurate on what the problem may be as 
			  well as show that patient a more accurate description of what they will be working with on the 
			  patient.
		  </p>
		  </div>
		  <div class="col-sm">
			<h2>Weaknesses</h2>
			<p class = "w3-large">
				However, with this benefits also comes with some drawbacks. One of them is Functionality. 
				Sometimes, specific software can only be compatible with specific hardware, and if not, it can 
				cause problems, may give inaccurate readings or even give the wrong type of information to the patient
				& doctor. Additionally, this type of technology is expensive, since most of the tech is still pretty much
				theoretical and pretty much in prototypes.

			  <h2>Physical Effects</h2>
			  <p class = "w3-large">
				<ul class="w3-large">
					<li>Nausea</li>
					<li>Sim Sickeness</li>
					<li>Eye Strain</li>
				  </ul>
				  <p class = "w3-large">
					Similar to the effects of VR gaming, too much usage of the technology can lead
					to eye strain and fatigue. Each effect also depends on the person using it
					as well as their tolerance to it.

      <h5 class="w3-center">By John Valeriano</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">For the longest time, the use of VR has been mainly used in the field of 
		  gaming. However, with the recent advancements of VR applications, it has seeped into the 
		  medical field as well. With it's beneficial applications, not only can VR entertain gamers or
		  give new immersive views, but can also benefit into the healthcare field.

      <p class="w3-large">VR has many different applications. However, for the
		  pase decade, its main focus was for gaming and entertainment such as a full interactive 360 videos
		  or VR gaming. But, with its beneficial technology, it has positive benefits in the medical field such 
		  as:
